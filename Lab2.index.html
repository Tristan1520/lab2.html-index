<em>Mmm, mmm, good!</em>

<h2>Ingredients you'll need:</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 pieces of bread</li>
<li>2 pats of butter</li>
<li>1 slice of monterey jack cheese</li>
<li>1 slice of aged cheddar cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Process:</h2>
<ol>    
<li>Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet</li>
<li>Heat the skillet over medium heat</li>
<li>Butter one side of each slice of bread</li>
<li>Place one slice of the buttered bread, buttered side down, into the skillet</li>
<li>Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover the entire surface area</li>
<li>Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese</li>
<li>Wait approximately <em>1 to 2 minutes</em> (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden brown)</li>
<li>Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other side till golden brown <em>(approximately 1 to 2 minutes)</em></li>
<li>Eat with ketchup, or just enjoy the plain crispy goodness of your grilled cheese</li>
</ol>

<h2>Note:</h2>
Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.
    
Remember, Shaun says <em>"Grilled cheese sandwiches are a staple of the North American diet!".</em>
